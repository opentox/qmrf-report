    "Disclaimer and Instructions": "Please fill in the fields of the QPRF with information about the prediction and the substance                                for which the prediction is made. The information that you provide will be used to facilitate                                considerations on the adequacy of the prediction (model result) in relation to a defined                                regulatory purpose.                                The adequacy of a prediction depends on the following conditions: a) the (Q)SAR model is                                scientifically valid: the scientific validity is established according to the OECD principles for                                (Q)SAR validation; b) the (Q)SAR model is applicable to the query chemical: a (Q)SAR is                                applicable if the query chemical falls within the defined applicability domain of the model; c)                                the (Q)SAR result is reliable: a valid (Q)SAR that is applied to a chemical falling within its                                applicability domain provides a reliable result; d) the (Q)SAR model is relevant for the                                regulatory purpose: the predicted endpoint can be used directly or following an                                extrapolation, possibly in combination with other information, for a particular regulatory                                purpose.                                A (Q)SAR prediction (model result) may be considered adequate if it is reliable and relevant,                                and depending on the totality of information available in a weight-of-evidence assessment                                (see Section 4 of the QPRF).",
